I wasn't particularly planning enchiladas when I picked out the tomatillos, but I knew I was going to make something verde, and tomatillos are produce that I try to pick up every time I see them... I just love their bright tartness.\nIn the end made Rick Bayless's Roasted Tomatillo salsa (multiplying quantities by 4 for 2 lbs of tomatillos)... omitting the onion because I was planning on using diced white onion as a garnish... and then substituted that as the salsa verde in the Simply Recipes' chicken enchiladas verde recipe because you should always roast tomatillos and chilis because... it's just a fact. A tasty fact. That Simply Recipes recipe is the first hit when you search for \"enchiladas verdes\" so if you've ever even considered the dish you've probably seen her recipe, but I was actually surprised to discover it did not have any baking time for the enchiladas at the end. You just use the oven to keep everything warm while you are assembling the enchiladas, which makes this a pretty good weeknight dinner option if you make the chicken and salsa ahead of time. Indeed, I found myself assembling a single (oven safe) plate on enchiladas for a bachelor dinner and just sticking it in a 200 degree oven for a few minutes to make sure it was warm.\nA good solid recipe that is very worth making.","version":"v0"}

The catch? She didn’t know how to cook.\nSchnatter initially thought his father had was crazy for hiring a cook with no skills in the kitchen. But his father insisted she’d be a great employee because of her great attitude. Robinson has been with Mick’s Tavern and now Papa John’s for more than three decades.\nSchnatter’s pizza operation -- which started in a broom closet in the back of Mick’s Tavern -- is a global franchise that racked up $1.4 billion in sales last year alone. Since his broom-closet days, Schnatter has learned a thing or two about being a boss. Top among them is the idea that you need to empower your employees to swim on their own.\nWatch this video to hear more about Schnatter’s views on being a boss.","version":"v0"}
